# Presenting Atmos Groups solutions in the MENA FHSS webinar

Last week, we had the privilege of presenting at the FHSS Webinar to an audience of nearly one hundred CSSD professionals from across the MENA region. The event was not only well attended but also highly engaging, with participants bringing forward thoughtful perspectives and questions that enriched the discussion.

Our presentation focused on two key areas. First, we introduced our AtmosDot labels, which are designed to bring greater reliability and clarity into sterilization workflows. Second, we offered a first look at AtmosTrack, our upcoming tracking system that aims to create even more transparency and efficiency in the process. It was rewarding to see the level of interest and the insightful dialogue these solutions sparked.

For us, opportunities like this are not just about presenting products. They are about sharing knowledge, listening carefully to the needs of professionals in the field, and making sure that when we enter a new market, we do so with purpose and responsibility. We want to build relationships that last, grounded in trust and mutual understanding.

We are especially grateful to Babak Rashnavadi, MBA, for both inviting us to the session and for his inspiring words. He expressed something that resonates deeply with our own philosophy: “We are not here to sell so that you buy, we are here to solve your problems.”

We also extend our thanks to Dr. Ahmed Baggashi and the MENA FHSS team for organizing such an excellent event. Bringing together professionals from across the region to exchange ideas and experiences is no small task, and the impact of such initiatives is significant.

As we look ahead, we are excited about the partnerships and opportunities that lie before us in the MENA region. This webinar was an important step forward, and we remain committed to supporting healthcare professionals with solutions that truly make a difference.
