# Meeting our distributors at the Global congress

It’s been truly gratifying to see how the colored identification labels for surgical instruments, developed here in Finland, have clarified and streamlined sterile processing workflows beyond our borders. We’re especially pleased to see our solution succeed internationally, for example, in hospitals in Bodø and Lofoten in Norway.

Hospital sterile processing units worldwide face the same familiar challenge every afternoon. Thousands of instruments arrive from morning surgical operations for washing and the sterilization process.

How do you keep identical-looking instruments separate? How can you ensure that the correct individual instrument is returned to its rightful owner – the correct department or team – after the washing process?

**Hospitals in Northern Norway, including those in Bodø and the Lofoten region, sought answers to these questions. The solution was found in our developed colored, laser-marked identification labels, AtmosDot.**

Each instrument is marked with a specific color by department, and a unique 2D Matrix code is laser-etched onto each label. The colored identifier speeds up departmental identification even before the washing process begins, allowing instruments from the same client to be processed together in the same washer. Even if washing is done in different machines, collecting the instruments afterwards is effortless and fast thanks to the color codes. Our solution offers hospitals worldwide a clear advantage in efficiency and traceability.
