# Meeting our distributors at the Global congress

What an incredible three days it has been for Atmos Group Finland at Hong Kong’s Sterilization Congress. Hosted at the impressive AsiaWorld-Expo, the event brought together leading professionals and innovators from across the global sterilization and healthcare technology community. The venue itself offered the perfect environment for high-level discussions, networking, and exploring the latest advancements shaping the future of CSSDs worldwide.

Throughout the congress, we met experts from around the world, exchanged valuable insights, shared countless laughs, and most importantly, deepened both new and existing partnerships with industry leaders.

We also had the opportunity to meet potential consumable distributors interested in bringing new solutions to the Finnish CSSD market — and we’re excited to share that negotiations are already underway. Expanding our consumables offering with international partners marks a significant step forward in strengthening our market presence and delivering even more value to our customers.

These moments reinforce something we’ve believed in from the very beginning: business is built on people. Meaningful connections remain at the heart of everything we do at Atmos Group, and they continue to drive our mission and growth.

A heartfelt thank you goes to Babak Rashnavadi, MBA and Iris Grabowski for opening doors to new international market opportunities right on the spot. Your support, vision, and innovative mindset truly make a difference — and we are excited about what comes next.

Of course, no visit to Hong Kong would be complete without experiencing the city itself. After long congress days, we explored Hong Kong’s vibrant nightlife, enjoyed amazing food, and took a ride on the famous Mid-Levels Escalator — the world’s longest outdoor covered escalator system. These moments offered the perfect balance between business and culture, reminding us just how special this city is.
