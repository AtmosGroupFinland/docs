# Packaging Surgical Instrument Sets

The packaging workflow is where you'll spend most of your time in AtmosTrack. This is where you prepare surgical instrument sets by scanning containers and adding the correct instruments for each surgery.

## How Packaging Works

### Your Daily Process
1. **Receive dirty instruments** from operating rooms
2. **Clean and inspect** instruments (outside of AtmosTrack)
3. **Scan container** to start packaging process in AtmosTrack
4. **Scan each instrument** as you place it in the container
5. **Verify completeness** before sealing and sterilizing
6. **Send to sterilization** with complete tracking

### Why Use AtmosTrack for Packaging
- **Prevent missing instruments** in surgery
- **Track every item** from start to finish
- **Speed up your workflow** with barcode scanning
- **Reduce errors** with automatic checking
- **Meet quality standards** and compliance requirements

## Starting Your Packaging Work

### Selecting a Container

**Step 1: Choose Your Department**
- Look at the left side of your screen
- Find the department you're working with (OR 1-5, ICU, Emergency, etc.)
- Click on the department to see available containers

**Step 2: Select a Container**
- You'll see a list of containers that need packaging
- Each container shows:
  - Container name and type
  - Current status (Clean, In Progress, etc.)
  - Department it belongs to
  - Any special notices or alerts

**Step 3: Scan or Click the Container**
- Either scan the container's barcode with your scanner
- Or click on the container in the list
- The container will be highlighted and ready for instruments

### Understanding Container Information

When you select a container, you'll see:
- **Container Details**: Name, barcode, and current status
- **Required Instruments**: Complete list of what should be included
- **Missing Items**: Red highlights show what you still need to add
- **Progress**: Visual indicator of how many items are complete

## Adding Instruments to Containers

### Basic Scanning Process

**Step 1: Scan the Instrument**
- Use your barcode scanner to scan each instrument
- AtmosTrack immediately recognizes what you scanned
- The system checks if the instrument belongs in this container

**Step 2: Visual Confirmation**
- Green checkmark = Instrument added successfully
- Red warning = Wrong instrument for this container
- Yellow alert = Instrument needs attention (maintenance, etc.)

**Step 3: Continue Until Complete**
- Keep scanning instruments until all items are green
- The progress indicator shows how close you are to completion
- Missing items remain highlighted in red

### What Happens When You Scan

**Correct Instrument:**
- ✅ Instrument is automatically added to the container
- Counter updates to show progress
- Visual confirmation with green highlight
- Automatic scroll to show the added item

**Wrong Instrument:**
- ❌ Warning message appears
- Instrument is not added to container
- Suggestion for where the instrument might belong
- No changes made to your current container

**Duplicate Instrument:**
- ⚠️ System alerts you that this instrument is already in the container
- Prevents double-counting
- Asks if you want to replace or ignore

### Working with Different Instrument Levels

Some containers have instruments organized by levels:

**Level 1 Instruments**: Basic surgical tools (forceps, scissors)
**Level 2 Instruments**: Specialized instruments (clamps, retractors)  
**Level 3 Instruments**: Advanced or procedure-specific tools

**How to work with levels:**
- Use the level tabs at the top of the instrument list
- Each level shows its own required instruments
- Scan instruments for the active level you're working on
- Switch levels by clicking the tabs or using keyboard shortcuts

## Quality Control and Validation

### Automatic Checking

AtmosTrack automatically checks for:
- **Missing Instruments**: Red highlighting shows what's still needed
- **Extra Instruments**: Warns if you've added something that doesn't belong
- **Damaged Items**: Alerts for instruments marked for maintenance
- **Expired Items**: Flags instruments past their service date

### Before Sending to Sterilization

**Final Checklist:**
1. All required instruments are green (added)
2. No red warnings for missing items
3. Container status shows "Ready for Sterilization"
4. Any special notices have been acknowledged

**Manual Override:**
- If an instrument is unavailable, you can mark it as "Substituted" 
- Add a note explaining why (broken, in maintenance, etc.)
- System tracks these exceptions for quality reporting
