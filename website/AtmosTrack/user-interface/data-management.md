# How AtmosTrack Keeps Your Data Safe and Accessible

AtmosTrack is designed to protect your hospital's important instrument tracking data while making sure it's always available when you need it. This guide explains how your information is managed and what it means for your daily work.

## Understanding Your Data in AtmosTrack

### What Information AtmosTrack Stores

**Container Information:**
- Container names and barcodes
- Which department each container belongs to
- Current status (Clean, In Progress, Sterilized, etc.)
- History of when containers were processed
- Any special notices or alerts

**Instrument Information:**
- Instrument names and barcodes
- Which containers they belong in
- Current location and status
- Maintenance history and service dates
- Quality control information

**User Activity:**
- Who scanned what and when
- Login times and logout records
- Changes made to containers or instruments
- Performance metrics for quality assurance

### How Your Data Stays Organized

**Department Structure:**
Your hospital's departments are organized like a family tree:
- Hospital → CSSD → Department → Containers → Instruments

This organization helps you find what you need quickly and ensures each department only sees their own containers.

## Real-Time Data Updates

### Why Real-Time Matters

**Immediate Updates:**
When you scan an instrument, everyone else using AtmosTrack sees the change immediately. This prevents:
- Two people working on the same container
- Confusion about which instruments are available
- Delays in surgery preparation
- Double-counting of instruments

**How It Works for You:**
- Scan an instrument → It appears instantly on all screens
- Another user makes a change → You see it immediately
- Equipment status changes → Everyone knows right away
- No need to refresh your browser or restart the program

### Multi-User Coordination

**Working as a Team:**
- Multiple people can use AtmosTrack at the same time
- System prevents conflicts when two people try to modify the same item
- Changes are synchronized across all devices in your hospital
- Work continues smoothly during shift changes

## Data Safety and Security

### Protecting Your Information

**Multiple Layers of Protection:**
1. **Login Security**: Only authorized users can access the system
2. **Data Encryption**: Information is protected during transmission
3. **Session Security**: Automatic logout prevents unauthorized access
4. **Access Controls**: Users only see data they're authorized to view

**What This Means for You:**
- Your work is automatically saved and protected
- Patient safety information remains confidential
- Hospital data stays within your organization
- Audit trails help with compliance and quality assurance

### Automatic Backups and Recovery

**Your Work Is Always Safe:**
- Everything is automatically saved as you work
- No risk of losing data if power goes out
- System recovers gracefully from technical issues
- Automatic backups protect against data loss

**If Something Goes Wrong:**
- Data is automatically restored from backups
- Work in progress is recovered when you log back in
- No manual backup procedures required
- IT support can restore specific information if needed

## Offline Capabilities

### Working Without Internet

**Limited Offline Access:**
- View recently accessed containers and instruments
- Reference information remains available

- Changes are saved locally until connection returns

**What Happens When Connection Returns:**
- All offline changes are synchronized automatically
- System resolves any conflicts intelligently
- No work is lost during offline periods
- Operations resume normally without intervention

### Managing Network Issues

**Common Scenarios:**
- **Slow Internet**: System works but may take longer to update
- **Brief Outages**: Work continues with cached data
- **Extended Outages**: Read-only access to recent information
- **Connection Restored**: Automatic synchronization of all changes

## Quality Control and Compliance
